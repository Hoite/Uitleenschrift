# Multi-Language Book Search Update

## 🌍 Enhanced Language Support

The Uitleenschrift app now supports multi-language book searches, perfect for Dutch readers who have books in multiple languages.

### Key Features:

1. **International Search**: First searches without language restrictions
2. **Dutch Books**: Additional search for Dutch-specific titles if needed
3. **Language Display**: Shows flag emojis (🇬🇧 🇳🇱 🇩🇪 🇫🇷 🇪🇸 🇮🇹) in match cards
4. **Duplicate Prevention**: Smart deduplication based on title+author
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing functionality remains unchanged

### How it Works:

- Users search for a book title and/or author
- API searches internationally first (all languages)
- If more results needed, searches specifically in Dutch
- Results show with language indicators
- Users can choose their preferred language version

### Supported Languages:

- 🇬🇧 English
- 🇳🇱 Dutch (Nederlands)
- 🇩🇪 German (Deutsch)
- 🇫🇷 French (Français)
- 🇪🇸 Spanish (Español)
- 🇮🇹 Italian (Italiano)
- 🌍 And more...

This gives Dutch users access to both local and international book collections!
